Above is a gif of a workout app I created using React Native, a Javascript framework created by Facebook to develop cross platform (iOS and Android) apps. 

The inspiration for this project came from the fact that sometimes could not remember if I had done 3 sets or 4 sets on a certain lift because I take 1.5-3 minutes rest between sets. After browsing through the App Store, I noticed all of the weight lifting apps were all too bloated with unecessary features, required too many steps to keep keep track of and time a lift, or had too much visual clutter. At the time, I had wanted to learn how to make an app anyway, so why not kill two birds with one stone and learn by building my own personal workout app?

Usage: Enter your exercise (name, weight, reps) in the bottom card and click the '+' to add it to your workout. Every time you complete a set, click on the number next to that exercise to mark its completion and automatically start the rest timer. Repeat for each set and exercise until finished.
